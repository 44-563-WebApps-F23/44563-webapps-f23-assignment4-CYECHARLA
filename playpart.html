        <p><b>HELMER.</b><br>Still, suppose that happened,—what then?</p>
        <p><b>NORA.</b><br>If that were to happen, I don’t suppose I should care whether 
            I owed money or not.</p>
        <P><b>HELMER.</b><br>Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?</P>
        <p><b>NORA.</b><br>They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were.</p>
        <p><b>HELMER.</b><br>That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about that.
             No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that depends on 
             borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely on the straight road so far, and we will go on 
             the same way for the short time longer that there need be any struggle.</p>
        <p><b>NORA.</b><br>_[moving towards the stove]_. As you please, Torvald.</p>
        <p><b>HELMER.</b><br>_[following her]_. Come, come, my little skylark must not droop her wings. 
            What is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper? _[Taking out his purse.]_ Nora, what do 
            you think I have got here?</p>
        <P><b>NORA.</b><br>_[turning round quickly]_. Money!</P>
        <p><b>HELMER.</b><br>There you are. _[Gives her some money.]_ Do you think I don’t know what a lot
             is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time?</p>
        <p><b>NORA.</b><br>_[counting]_. Ten shillings—a pound—two pounds! Thank you, thank you, Torvald; 
            that will keep me going for a long time.</p>
        <P><b>HELMER.</b><br>Indeed it must.</P>
        <p><b>NORA.</b><br>Yes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I have bought. 
            And all so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and a sword; and a horse and a trumpet 
            for Bob; and a doll and dolly’s bedstead for Emmy,—they are very plain, but anyway she will 
            soon break them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the maids; old 
            Anne ought really to have something better.</p>
        <P><b>HELMERy.</b><br>And what is in this parcel?</P>
